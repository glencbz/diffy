# Components

A component map names what each part of a series' changes is, such as a
schema, a command, a view or the wiring between them, so a reader can see
what a commit builds and move between the parts that belong together. An
agent writes it; the reader reads it laid over the series screens.

## The component map

A map belongs to one version of a series, since its places name line numbers
that only that version's commits have. It
sits in the [review document](review.md#review-state), so an agent writes it
through the same store and every open screen hears about it.

A component belongs to one commit, and keeps its `id` across versions. Two
versions' maps then agree on which component is which, so a reader comparing
versions can be told that a component is new, gone or changed without the
agent having to say so.

A place is a run of lines on one side of the commit's diff, as a comment's
anchor is: the `after` side counts the commit's own tree and the `before`
side its parent's. A place that moves code out of one spot names the place
that takes it in, and the other way round, so the two ends of a move link to
each other.

```ts
//| id: frontend-model-components
//| file: src/frontend/model/components.ts
import * as z from "zod";

/** Lines of one file a commit changes, counted from 1 on `side`, both ends
 *  included. */
export const ComponentPlace = z.object({
  path: z.string(),
  side: z.enum(["before", "after"]).default("after"),
  start: z.number().int().positive(),
  end: z.number().int().positive().optional(),
  /** What this place does for its component, in a few words. */
  about: z.string().default(""),
  /** The place of the same component that this one moves code to or from. */
  moves: z.number().int().nonnegative().optional(),
});
export type ComponentPlace = z.infer<typeof ComponentPlace>;

/** What a component does for its commit, which the rail groups by. */
export const ComponentRole = z.enum([
  "implements",
  "refactors",
  "wires",
  "tests",
]);
export type ComponentRole = z.infer<typeof ComponentRole>;

/** One piece of work a commit does, named for what it is. */
export const Component = z.object({
  commitId: z.string(),
  /** The same in every version, so each version's map names the same
   *  component the same way. */
  id: z.string().min(1),
  /** What it is: schema, command, view, wiring, test. */
  kind: z.string().min(1),
  name: z.string().min(1),
  role: ComponentRole,
  /** What it does, in a sentence. */
  gist: z.string().default(""),
  /** Names in the code that mean this component. */
  words: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  /** Phrases in the commit's message that describe it. */
  mentions: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  /** In reading order. */
  places: z.array(ComponentPlace).min(1),
});
export type Component = z.infer<typeof Component>;

/** What each commit of one version of a series builds, component by
 *  component. */
export const ComponentMap = z.object({
  series: z.string(),
  version: z.string(),
  author: z.string(),
  writtenAt: z.string(),
  components: z.array(Component),
});
export type ComponentMap = z.infer<typeof ComponentMap>;

/** The map of one version of a series, if one was written. */
export function componentsTo(
  maps: ComponentMap[],
  series: string,
  version: string,
): ComponentMap | undefined {
  return maps.find((map) => map.series === series && map.version === version);
}

/** `maps` with `map` in place of any map of the same version. */
export function withComponents(
  maps: ComponentMap[],
  map: ComponentMap,
): ComponentMap[] {
  return [
    ...maps.filter(
      (kept) => kept.series !== map.series || kept.version !== map.version,
    ),
    map,
  ];
}
```

## Tests

```ts
//| id: frontend-model-components-test
//| file: src/frontend/model/components.test.ts
import { describe, expect, test } from "bun:test";
import {
  type Component,
  type ComponentMap,
  componentsTo,
  withComponents,
} from "./components";

function component(id: string, commitId = "c1"): Component {
  return {
    commitId,
    id,
    kind: "command",
    name: id,
    role: "implements",
    gist: "",
    words: [],
    mentions: [],
    places: [{ path: "a.ts", side: "after", start: 1, about: "" }],
  };
}

function map(version: string, ids: string[]): ComponentMap {
  return {
    series: "local:r",
    version,
    author: "claude",
    writtenAt: "t",
    components: ids.map((id) => component(id)),
  };
}

describe("component maps", () => {
  test("keeps one map to each version, the newest written", () => {
    // arrange
    const maps = withComponents([map("1", ["a"])], map("2", ["a"]));

    // act
    const rewritten = withComponents(maps, map("1", ["b"]));

    // assert
    expect(rewritten).toHaveLength(2);
    expect(componentsTo(rewritten, "local:r", "1")?.components[0]?.id).toBe(
      "b",
    );
    expect(componentsTo(rewritten, "local:r", "3")).toBeUndefined();
  });
});
